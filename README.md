If you're using Version Catalog, you can configure the dependency by adding it to your
`libs.versions.toml` file as follows:
<details open>

```toml
[versions]
kalendar = "<version>"
kalendarFoundation = "<version>"

[libraries]
charty = { module = "com.himanshoe:kalendar", version.ref = "kalendar" }
charty = { module = "com.himanshoe:kalendar-foundation", version.ref = "kalendarFoundation" }
```

</details>

### Gradle

    // if you're using Version Catalog
