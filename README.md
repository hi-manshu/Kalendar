## Introduction

With Compose getting the attention, it was about time to have its own Calendar. Kalendar is all
about it with the customization and design.

## Implementation

### Gradle setup

In `build.gradle` of app module, include this dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
        implementation("com.himanshoe:kalendar:0.0.1-alpha1")
}
```

### Usage

#### 1. Setup the Kalendar

```kotlin
    Kalendar(kalendarType = KalendarType.Firey(), onCurrentDayClick = {
    //handle the date click listener                                                       
}, errorMessage = {
    //Handle the error if any
})

```

### 2. Pass KalendarType

You need to pass the KalendarType with its value in the constructor. It has two values `Firey`
and `Ocenic`. Firey repesents the MonthView like:

and Ocenic represents the Week View.

### 3. Edit KalendarKonfig

By default it takes the initial values added to it.

```kotlin
data class KalendarKonfig(
    val yearRange: YearRange = YearRange(),
)
```

where,

```kotlin
YearRange takes value min -max for years in Int
```

### 4. KalendarStyle
You can customize you calendar by editing the params in KalendarStyle which looks like,
```kotlin
data class KalendarStyle(
    val kalendarBackgroundColor: Color? = null,
    val kalendarColor: Color? = null,
    val hasRadius: Boolean = true,
    val elevation: Dp = if (hasRadius) Grid.One else 0.dp,
    val shape: Shape = ButtomCurvedShape,
)
```
